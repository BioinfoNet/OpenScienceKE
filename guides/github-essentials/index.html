        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
        <p>GitHub is a web-based interface for version control, a way of keeping track of changes made to a collection of working documents. GitHub provides a structure and space for communicating about collaborative work on open projects. <strong> With bit of set-up, and a good workflow, you can make your project accessible and transparent, and create a respectful and productive working environment for your collaborators.</strong></p>
        <p>This exercise walks you through a workflow for using Git/Github through the GitHub web interface and through the GitHub Desktop App. You will learn through examples about how to make commits, create issues, create branches and merge them, and revert commits. You will also begin writing things in Markdown - a simple "markup" language used for blogging, documentation, and even writing papers! </p>

                <h1>Sign up and install</h1>
                <p>
                    Start by signing up with Github Online and installing the Github Desktop

                <h1>Create a Repo</h1>
                <p>
                    Every project starts by creating a "new repository"
                </p>
                <img src="../../assets/images-slides/new-repo.png">
            </li>
            <!-- Step 2 -->
            <li>
                <h1>Create a title & description</h1>
                <p>Create a project title and description. Good practice is to either use dashes ("-") or underscores ("_") between words in your title (e.g. my-first-repo or my_first_repo)</p>
                <p>Write a short description of your repository.</p>
                <p>Initialize your repo with a README - the title and description you write above will be shown by default.</p>
                <p>If you are sure what kind of license you want on your repo, select one here, or put your own license in later.</p>

                <h1>Your first commit</h1>
                <p>Let's start by adding some content to your README. To make your first commit, you are going to follow a few steps:
                </p>
                <p><strong>First: Click on the README.md & then edit button</strong></p>

# Friendly Collaboration Party 

This repository is for planning a party to learn GitHub and more!

## About
This is some text about my project. It is interesting because it answers this question about the universe. 

## Team
So far my team is small - just 1 person, but I'm willing to work with you!

## Setup & Requirements
This project requires a computer and internet.

                <p><strong>Third: Add a commit message</strong> - Your commit message should point to the changes that you've made (e.g. added content to readme) and press the commit button!

            <li>
                <h1>Create an Issue</h1>
                <p>Go to the Issues Tab and create and issue about a task you want to complete (e.g. need more detailed README or create CODEOFCONDUCT.md).</p>

                <p>Assign the task to yourself where it says "Assignee" and "Assign yourself"</p>

                <p>Label the task in a category you thin is appropriate - or create a new label!</p>

                <p>here is a video showing this process</p>

            </li>
            <li>
                <h1>Create a branch, make changes, merge them in</h1>

                <p>In this step, make a branch to work on some new content for your newly added repo, make a commit, and merge those changes from your new branch into your master branch. </p> 
                <iframe width="720" height="600" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zgxaNRA7e1Q" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                <p>For the example of the writing sample, a new branch ("new-title")is created to add a new title to the thesis. A new title is added and the file is committed to the new branch called "new-title".</p>

                <p>After making the changes, we decide that the master branch needs to have this same title, SO, we:
                 </p>
                 <ul>
                    <li>- toggle back to the master branch</li>
                    <li>- click the "compare" button and select the "new-title" branch.</li>
                    <li>- and "update from 'new-title' " which merges those changes in. </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Last, we check the file to see if the changes have been merged from the "new-title" branch to the "master" branch.</p>
                
              
                <h2>A Note on switching back and forth between branches</h2>
                <p>Notice when we switch back and forth between branches how the title is different. While it appears that "thesis.doc" is the same file, Git is running in the background to make sure that the changes you applied are properly applied based on which branch you're in.</p>

            <li>
                <h1> Revert a commit</h1>
                <p>
                   The last piece of functionality we will try is to revert a commit. In a situation in which you are not happy with a commit, you can "revert" the commit by:
                </p>

                <h2>First: click on the commit you want to revert</h2>
                <img src="../../assets/images-slides/revert-1.png">

                <h2>Second / third: click the "gear icon" and "revert this commit" ... then sync!</h2>
