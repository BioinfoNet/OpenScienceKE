# Promoting Open Science in Bioinformatics

## Background

This project seeks to sensitize and promote open and reproducible Bioinformatics research within Nairobi. The target groups are the graduate students and highly motivated undergraduate students in local universities within Nairobi region. Through the project, we aim to promote open, reproducible and collaborative Bioinformatics research and produce researchers equipped with tools -- Git & GitHub, reproducible research notebooks (Rmarkdown and Jupyter) -- for open and collaborative research.  The participants will be ready to tackle local Bioinformatics challenges. In addition, this project is a step towards building a community of Open Scientists who will promote open and collaborative research.

## Participate

You can participate in a number of ways, including:
1. You are familiar with open science tools and would  like to offer to train or  contribute to training materials
2. You are a Bioinformatics student, or enthusiasts, and would like to participate in our workshops and/or hackathons
3. You are an open Science advocate within Nairobi and would love to give a lecture in one of our events
4. You Love open science and would like to fund our events
