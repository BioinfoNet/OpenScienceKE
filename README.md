# OpenScienceKE: Promoting Open Science in Bioinformatics
Welcome to OpenScienceKE! Thank you for your interest in our project. We are open science enthusiasts -- scientists, researchers and students -- led by [Caleb Kibet](https://github.com/kipkurui), seeking to promote open science practices in Bioinformatics. 

## Background
 We are working with Bioinformatics students and researchers to promote open, collaborative and reproducible Bioinformatics Research in Nairobi, Kenya so that we can we can build a community of Bioinformaticians who can collaborate and spread the open science message. 
 
We seek to address the following problems:
- the lack of awareness of Open Science practices and tools within the Bioinformatics community in Kenya
- the poor adoption of open science practices in Bioinformatics
- the absence of research to establish the where we are as a country (Kenya) in adopting open science

Through the project, we aim to promote open, reproducible and collaborative Bioinformatics research and produce researchers equipped with tools -- Git & GitHub, reproducible research notebooks (Rmarkdown and Jupyter) -- for open and collaborative research. The participants will be ready to tackle local Bioinformatics challenges. In addition, this project is a step towards building a community of Open Scientists who will promote open and collaborative research.

From this project, we aim to deliver a community of Bioinformaticians who can collaborate and spread the open science message. We also aim to generate information on the status of open science in Kenya which can be used by policymakers and academic institutions, and a resource that can guide students on where they can publish open access at a low cost. Finally, create open Science training resources available in a reusable licence: CC BY 4.0. 

Welcome to this exciting journey!

## Participate and Contribute
Although the project targets the field of Bioinformatics, contributions from any field are welcome. You can participate in a number of ways, including:
1. You are familiar with open science tools (Git and GitHub, Linux Commandline, Jupyter Notebooks, RMarkdown and Notebooks) and would like to offer to train or contribute to training materials
2. You are a Bioinformatics student, or enthusiasts, and would like to participate in our workshops and/or hackathons
3. You are an open Science advocate within Nairobi and would love to give a talk in one of our events
4. You Love open science and would like to fund our events

Have a look at the [#OpenScienceKE](https://github.com/BioinfoNet/OpenScienceKEHackathon) repo for additional ways of contributing to the specific projects. 

## Events
We are organizing seminars in May, workshops in August, hackathons in September, and Meetups afterwards. Keep an eye [this page](https://kipkurui.github.io/studyGroup/) for our events posting. 

### 1. OpenScienceKE Seminars
See [this page](./OpenScienceSeminar.md) for more information.

### 2. OpenScienceKE Workshops
Our Open Science Workshop will be held on 9th and 10th August 2017 at the KENET training room, Jomo Kenyatta Memorial Library, the University of Nairobi from 9 am to 5 pm. Applications to participate in the workshop can be made through [this Google Form](https://goo.gl/forms/s3aik3R6Uy0dannd2) (Applications Closed). 

#### Workshop Schedule
The schedule for this workshop can be accessed [here](./schedule.md).

## 3. OpenScienceKE Hackathon
Our Open science hackathon is scheduled for 30th and 31st August 2018. Check the [hackathon repo](https://github.com/BioinfoNet/OpenScienceKEHackathon) for the projects, and details on how you can contribute.


## 4. OpenScienceKE Meetups
The final stage of OpenScienceKE is to form a community that will keep the conversation going. We'll be organizing regular meetups within Nairobi.
